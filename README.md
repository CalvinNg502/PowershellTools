# Powershell Tools

## Overview

This repository contains basic powershell tool/scripts that are helpful in my work and personal projects.

## Scripts

- SearchString: ctrl+f recursively over all files and subdirectories. Enter directory to search and string to search for. Useful for .txt or other plaintext files. I commonly use this during modding to search for where certain events, flags, etc appear in vanilla code. Returns the relative file path of file, line, and line number for each string found.
